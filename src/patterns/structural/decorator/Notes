Decorator Pattern

"Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by 
placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors."

->Imagine the i have one object, and i a tell him a method say(), 
expecting a return "Hello World". Now, i want to change the functionality, 
but i will not change all the content, i will wrap in to a new one, and know this 
new one works  over the last one. 

->It is like attaching new responsabilits over the object

-> The solution applicated in the examples, it isnÂ´t the best for situations that i have to many classes.
