Brigde Pattern

"Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set 
of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—
abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other."

-> This method helps to avoid to many classes on a Cartesian Product for example.

-> Let´s create a simple program that uses resources and view formats, without
the need of create one class for each possibility
