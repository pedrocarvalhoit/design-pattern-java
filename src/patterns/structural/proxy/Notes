Proxy Pattern

"Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute 
or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, 
allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object."

"Proxies delegate all of the real work to some other object. Each proxy method should,
 in the end, refer to a service object unless the proxy is a subclass of a service."

-> Remote proxy: Exist to access a object that is remote
->Virtual: Control access to a resource tha is expensive to create
->Protection: To avoide not secure clients access determinated object that he donÂ´t have right credential
