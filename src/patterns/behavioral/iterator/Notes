Iterator Pattern

"Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements 
of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.)."

-> The main intention of an iterator is pass through some list

-> It is good for avoid expose data while iterating between them.

	private Profile findProfile(String profileEmail) {
		profiles.stream().filter(e -> e.equals(profileEmail)).forEach(System.out::println);
		return null;
	}
